# P565-465-PatientHealthInsuranceManagementSystem
With the advancement in technology and popularity of the internet a lot of people use the web for a variety of purposes. One such system can be used to keep track of the health insurance and patient information. This system should have multiple views i.e. the patient's, doctor's and insurance provider's view. The patient should be able to update their health information and their insurance plans. The insurance providers should be able to view all the patientâ€™s information and provide the best insurance deal to the patients. The doctor's view should provide the doctor with access to his patient's medical history. The patient should be able to book appointments with the doctors and select the doctors based on their symptoms. The insurance providers should be able to provide a quote to the patients depending on their health record. The doctors need to have a restricted access to only their patients. The system could also be used as a platform for doctors to keep track of number of COVID-19 patients that have been admitted along with the number of beds allocated/ available for a COVID-19 patient(s) or provide virtual assistance to COVID-19 patients through automated assessments of the symptoms.
